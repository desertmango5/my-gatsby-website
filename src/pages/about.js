    <h2>The Short Story</h2>
    <p>
      This is where I reveal my amazing life; the social media version of me. No worts. No mistakes. I have it ALL together. Gosh-darn-it-people-like-me stuff. Hmmm...
    </p>
    <p>
      I learned an important lesson about being genuine when my wife and I were just getting to know each other. We found ourselves on an overnight backpacking trip with mutual friends in the Superstition Mountains in Arizona. If you've ever been backpacking, you know that your hair gets messed up, your clothes are dirty, and, if you're like me, you might develop an odd smell. On that trip the normal dating pretenses were blown away and she saw a much closer version of the real me. For 30 miles, Kelly and I hiked and talked without the pretenses of looking and acting like the best versions of ourselves. The results? We were married in October 2001 and I feel like I married the same person I dated because we had been real with each other from the beginning.  
    </p>
    <p>
      If it's true that we are all our own brand, I want my brand to the real version of myself. Hair messed up. Clothes dirty. Me being a little smelly. In one word: <em>real</em> 
    </p>
    <h2>The TLDR Story</h2>
    <p>
      I often hear myself telling my three sons that they need to learn from their mistakes. That is good advice for me, too. There are so many times I would love to go back in time so I could have a redo. Of course, I cannot but I can prevent history from repeating itself by learning from my mistakes. Below I'm going to share some of what my history has taught me. 
    </p>
    <h3>Today</h3>
    <p>
      It seems like friends and family from home assume that my life is one adventure after another. After all, since 2009 my family and I have lived overseas in the United Arab Emirates. Living overseas has been fascinating for all the obvious reasons. We've been able to travel to London, Paris, Singapore, Seoul, Thailand, Oman, and Kuwait. Honestly, though, life is pretty routine. My wife is a kindergarten teacher for the Abu Dhabi government. Our three teenage sons are home schooled and take tennis lessons twice a week. Since June 2017, after ending a three year stint with a Dubai startup, I have been pinned to my laptop learning frontend web development. It's been 9 years since we moved to the Middle East and after this school year, we intend to complete our time here. The Arabic word is <em>khalas</em>.
    </p>
    <h4>Cultural Lessons</h4>
    <p>
       Living in another culture teaches you a lot about yourself. For instance, did you know that outside of western countries people do <em>not</em> look both ways before stepping into traffic? They just go and then are surprised when they look up to see your car coming at them. That, my friend, is cultural influence. I look both ways when crossing the street for one reason: I happened to be born in the United States. I was influenced by my culture and didn't even know it until I was outside that cultural box. My sense of personal space, considering how my actions will affect others, and saying "thank you" are programmed into me by my culture. But here's the take away. One culture is not <em>better</em> than another. Cultures are <em>different</em>, not better. That was my culture shock moment many years ago. Once I started viewing my culture's way as different rather than better, I started to see that different is ok. This has made it easier to extend a little grace to people who might step on my cultural toes. I'm probably stepping on their toes, too!
    </p>
    <h4>Parenting Lessons</h4>
    <p>
      Kelly and I have three sons. As of this writing in early 2018, our oldest is 14 years old and we have 12 year old fraternal twins. All three were born prematurely and required NICU hospital stays. The twins spent nearly the first two months of their lives in the hospital and about two years eating through feeding tubes. Thankfully, they are completely healthy now. Kelly was amazing during those first couple years; they would not be doing as well as they are without her tireless effort. I'm certain of that. 
    </p>
    <p>
      When it comes to areas in my life full of mistakes, parenting is probably at the top of that list. But I try to learn from my mistakes. For example:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Being a parent exposes your weaknesses. Boys not showing respect to each other? I need to better model what respect looks like.</li>
      <li>Kids (and people in general) don't care about what you say. They care about what you do.</li>
      <li>Kids (and people in general) respond better to calm discussion than to yelling. Who'd of thunk it?</li>
      <li>When you are wrong, look your kids in the eyes and humbly own it.</li>
      <li>Respect your kids enough to talk <strong><em>to</em></strong> them rather than talk <strong><em>at</em></strong> them.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Adulting</h3>
    <p>
      Recently, my Grandpa passed away. He was born in 1924 and was 94 years old. I find myself thinking about all that changes he witnessed during his life. Radio. TV. World War II. Atomic/nuclear bombs. Internet. Mobile phones. Being able to talk with and see his great-grandsons half a world away on a computer screen. When I was a kid he told me that thought it would be cool to see the year 2000. Simply amazing.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is one more event my Grandpa witness and I'm guessing he probably was not impressed: the idea of 'adulting'. To him, growing up and being an adult was not optional; it's what a person did. I know, I sound like an old curmudgeon, <em>I am the Decrepit Webdev</em>, after all. I see the adulting jokes and I even laugh at them. I get that adulting is hard. I've been doing it for a bit. But just because it's hard should not make it optional. In fact, when I was a kid I couldn't wait to be an adult. Is it hard? Yes. Do I want to be a kid again so everything is done for me? Hell, no!!! I take pride in being able to adult. I don't see it as optional.
    </p>
    <h3>Work Experiences</h3>
    <p>
      This is not meant to be a resumé but rather a glimse into my experiences and some of my takeaways. My hope is that in sharing this you will feel like you know me. Some of my lessons are negative in nature, so I might withhold some company names. My intention is to share what I've learned, not malign former employers. I am thankful for all these opportunities.
    </p>
    <h4>IT Manager - Dubai Startup</h4>
    <p>For three years I had the title of IT Manager. But that was a loose title; I wore many hats.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Graphic Designer</li>
      <li>eCommerce Manager</li>
      <li>Sports Photographer</li>
      <li>Product Photographer</li>
      <li>Marketing</li>
      <li>Webmaster (for lack of a better term)</li>
      <li>The Tech Guy</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Basically, I was the person handling anything technical and/or creative. Much of what I did was learned on the fly because someone had to do it. As I've heard is said in Japan when a job needs to be done, 'Why not me?'</p>
    <p><strong>What I Learned</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Communication is HUGE and bad communication destroys trust and morale. Several times I was ready to cut ties with this operation and the #1 reason was lack of communication. People feel valued when we make the effort to communicate with them!</li>
      <li>Be wise. Do not work without a contract. I wanted to trust in good intentions but the so-called promise of future pay is not a salary. Protect yourself and get the terms in writing.</li>
      <li>I picked up several new skills: basic design principles, Photoshop, Illustrator, product & sports photography, Shopify e-commerce platform, HTML/CSS, email marketing, working remotely, and how to do business with people from a variety of cultural backgrounds.</li>
      <li>Negotation is a valuable skill. If I don't like the initial offer, make a counter offer. Be creative.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Professional Photographer</h4>
    <p>
      Since 2011 I have been a professional photographer here in Al Ain, UAE. My paid work has primarily been individual and family desert portraits but I also have been hired by several businesses. If you have flown Air Berlin anytime in the last few years you might have seen my Abu Dhabi photos in their in-flight magazine, including the cover. 
    </p>
    <p><strong>What I Learned</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Self-critique is extremely difficult but necessary.</li>
      <li>Do not be afraid to put your work out in public.</li>
      <li>High quality sells itself.</li>
      <li>The difference between a professional and an amateur is the professional does not let anyone see their crap work.</li>
      <li>It takes more than a camera to be photographer. I spent <em>years</em> studying photography. My education continues and always will.</li>
      <li>I learned how to learn.</li>
      <li>There is not a magic setting on your camera that will make your photos awesome.</li>
      <li>You never know what another person is going to like. Several times a client has loved a photo that I was hesitant to even show them and other times they hardly notice my favorite photo from their shoot. Therefore, let people make their own choices.</li>
      <li>Always keep your word.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr/>
    <h4>Retail Management</h4>
    <p>
      I spent a few years in management with a fast-paced, high volume company that rewarded hard work and results. This company is different from any other I worked for. For instance, if they implemented an idea that sounded good on paper but fell flat in practice, rather than blame the employees for failing to carry out their vision, they acknowledged that it was not working and scrapped the idea. I respected them so much for this. 
    </p>
    <p><strong>What I Learned</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Admitting that your idea is not working is not a sign of weakness. Throw that crazy idea out there but if it's not working, just own it and move on. Your employees will love you for it.</li>
      <li>'Never Be Satisfied' is a great company motto. We can always do better. <em>However</em>, that motto should not prevent supervisors from giving positive feedback. Eventually, <em>never be satisfied</em> begins to feel like <em>never good enough</em>.</li>
      <li>Good Results + Relationships > Great Results alone. When it came to results, I stood out from the crowd. In fact, I was one of the managers brought in to turn around struggling stores. But my rapid managerial rise only went so far. My supervisor confided that my results were stellar but that my people skills needed work. Even though at the time the idea had not yet gained mainstream traction, he was telling me that I need to improve my Emotional Intelligence. It was difficult to hear but he was right. </li>
    </ul>
    <hr/>
    <h4>Personal Banker</h4>
    <p>
      This job sounds better than it actually was. I was a salesman and my product was debt. The bank made a ton of money from credit cards and home equity loans, therefore, everyone who walked through the door should leave with a shiny new credit card in their wallet and/or a new line of credit. To use the old cliché, I felt like a slimy used car salesman. For what it's worth, I was the top banker in my branch.
    </p>
    <p><strong>What I Learned</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>When it comes to money, people are <em>very</em> serious.</li>
      <li>It's common for people to be upset when they go the bank. This gave me many opportunities to improve my people skills, especially defusing tense situations. 'What would you like me to do for you' is one of the most invaluable customer service techniques I've learned. Staying calm is key. Don't take what the customer says personally. My job is to help them.</li>
      <li>People are suspicious of banks.</li>
      <li>Sales should not have to be high pressure if your product solves a real problem.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr/>
    <h4>University Financial Aid Processor</h4>
    <p>
      This is a difficult job to discuss because my biggest takeaways are negative and cynical. One positive was my co-workers. I really enjoyed the people I worked with.  
    </p>
    <p>
      I held two positions at this private <em>for-profit</em> university. At the time, we were pushing the boundries of online education and most of our students were spread across the U.S. I started as a financial aid advisor connecting with students over the phone. After a short period of time, I was promoted to financial aid processor. I processed all the FAFSA finicial aid including processing and dispersing federal and private student loans. I was also a liaison between the university financial aid office and the accounting office. 
    </p>
    <p><strong>What I Learned</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>For-profit and education should NOT mix. It's impossible to hold students to a high standard when they are viewed as customers.</li>
      <li>Crap work in large quantities gets rewarded.</li>
      <li>The people who find that crap work and fix it are not rewarded. Their numbers are too low.</li>
      <li>Companies often say one thing but mean another.</li>
      <li>Cubicles suck.</li>
      <li>Most people in a certain region of the U.S. do not say 'goodbye' when a phone conversation is over. They just hang up. It's nothing personal--that's just how they roll.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr/>
    <h4>Dicing Saw Operator</h4>
    <p>
      When I began this job, the company was small and privately owned. I worked a full-time overnight shift while attending school full-time during the day. We made ultrasonic transducers--those devices you think of when a woman has an ultrasound of her unborn baby. In fact, the company founder had invented a production technique that at the time made our product cutting edge. It was the first 3-D ultrasound. 
    </p>
    <p>
      After almost a year, our company merged with GE Medical Systems. Until this point, the atmosphere was relaxed and I knew everyone. It felt like a family. After the merge, that changed. Everything became driven by numbers. 
    </p>
    <p><strong>What I Learned</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>When I started, I saw this position as temporary. When I finished school, I would be leaving. Since I did not intend to stay long-term, it did not seem right to me at the time to take any promotions. So right up front I indicated this. Now I realize this was a mistake and it cost me opportunites. I should never predetermine my future.</li>
      <li>We had a diverse team and no one really gave it much thought. Everyone worked at getting along and everyone did their job well. It was a great group of people to work with.</li>
      <li>Our team was much more productive when we were a private company. The manager was hands-off but there when we needed him. He trusted us to be adults and to do our job. </li>
      <li>If given the choice to work for a small, private company or a large corporation, I would most likely choose the small company.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr/>
    <h4>In-home Computer Tech</h4>
    <p>
      Do you remember the electronics retailer, Circuit City? They have been defunct for over a decade and rightly so. I left the company about 4 months before they closed up shop and, to put it mildly, they were a dumpster fire. I was hired to be a <em>Firedog</em> which was their version of BestBuy's <em>Geek Squad</em>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The manager of the computer department was a bald guy named Scott who literally could not connect his laptop to the wifi. Everyday he asked me to do it for him. One of the services we offered was in-home computer setup. That meant unpackaging all the hardware, connecting it (neatly), doing basic configurations, and installing extra software like antivirus and Microsoft Office. The package description also indicated some basic computer training once everything was up and running. Back then it took about 20 minutes just to install the drivers for an HP printer. Scott seemed to think all this should take 30 minutes. Maybe 35 if you go slow.  
    </p>
    <p><strong>What I Learned</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Don't just give lip service to things like customer service and employee loyalty.</li>
      <li>I worked in the store on a Black Friday and it was one of the worst experiences of my life.  <em>Black Friday comes straight from the pits of hell</em>.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr/>
    <h4>OTR Truck Driver</h4>
    <p>
      The most difficult job I've ever had? This one. I was an over-the-road truck driver. For me, that meant spending 2-4 weeks at a time sitting in a drivers seat inside a small moving box that sits 10 feet off the ground. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This job carried a heavy mental and physical toll on me. It was difficult to spend so much time alone with my thoughts. I've joked that I went crazy several times during my year+ of driving. Pardon the pun, but there was also heavy physical toll--I got <em>really</em> fat while driving. And what would expect when you sit on your bum day after day eating fried truckstop food for every meal? 
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a few upsides to truck driving. I was able to scratch my travel itch by driving through 43 of the 50 states and Canada. And the pay was good.
    </p>
    <p><strong>What I Learned</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>We should have a lot more respect for truck drivers. They have a difficult and dangerous job.</li>
      <li>I need to stay physcially active when I have a sedentary job. You know, like web development.</li>
    </ul>
