# My Official Website

### A [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) website powered by [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com/blog/gatsby-graphcms-plugin/)

I am replacing the Squarespace website I've had for years. My Squarespace site is primarily devoted to my photography side business. IMO it's a beautiful site and I love building Squarespace websites. Their themes have amazing design baked in. In certain situations, I would _highly_ recommend using [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/) to build your website.

There are two reasons for building a new website:
1. I am _learning by doing_. In other words, as I continue to study frontend web development technology I need real opportunities to put them into practice. This project uses:
  * ReactJS
  * GatsbyJS 
  * GraphQL
  * CSS Modules
  * Grid CSS
  * Netlify
  * And much more

2. Since I am studying to prepare for a frontend web development career, I want my website to focus more on webdev and a little less on photography. Since 2011, my photography business, if you want to call it that, has been a word-of-mouth endevour in the medium sized city of Al Ain, United Arab Emirates that somewhat keeps me out of trouble and brings in a little extra money (we usually save it to buy our 3 sons Christmas presents ‚úùÔ∏è üéÖüèª ).
